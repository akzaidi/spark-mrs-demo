# Provisioning Instructions

This module provides a walkthrough of how to provision a Spark cluster on Azure HDInsight Premium with Microsoft R Server, and how to add an edge node with RStudio Server.

## Provision Cluster from Azure Portal

The [Azure documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/hdinsight-hadoop-r-server-overview/) page provides details on how to provision a Spark cluster with Microsoft R Server.

The first steps are outlined here: [Get started using R Server on HDInsight (preview)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/hdinsight-hadoop-r-server-get-started/)

I have summarized the steps here to help you get started quickly:

* Login to [portal.azure.com](ms.portal.azure.com) with your Azure subscription
* New -> Data + Analytics -> HDInsight
* Choose Premium cluster: R Server on Spark
* Create an sshkey, using putty or openSSH, and include the public key in the credentials tab
* [Install RStudio Server on the Edge Node](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/hdinsight-hadoop-r-server-install-r-studio/)
* Tunnel into your RStudio Server instance, and start your ML pipeline!

## Installing Packages

For packages you only need to run on the edge node, you can continue using `install.packages`. For packages you need installed on the edge node as well as all the worker nodes, you'll need to use a [script action](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/hdinsight-hadoop-r-server-get-started/#install-r-packages)
