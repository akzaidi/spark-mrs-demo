## Functional Programming and Lazy Evaluation in R

As we mentioned in Section \@ref(lazyevalfp), Spark takes advantage of the functional programming paradigm and lazy evaluation to optimize it's operations and improve upon algorithmic complexity. R is also at it's heart a functional programming langauge. Moreover, the arguments in a function are evaluated lazily by R: only evaluated if they're actually used, and only when they're needed. This allows R to be highly expressive, capable of doing many intricate things with few lines of code, but also causes R to have a rather heavy memory footprint.

Many packages for R have been written to take advantage of it's lazy, and non-standard evaluation procedures. Most famously, the dplyr package utlizes R's NSE mechanism to have it's functions connect to backends in different databases, translating R into syntax that can be understood and evaluated by those backends.

Thee RevoScaleR similarly reimagines R's algorithms as distributable C++ code, taht can be optimized and compiled in various compute contexts.
