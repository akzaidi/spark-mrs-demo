description: "These are (tentatively) rough notes showcasing some tips on conducting large scale data analysis with R, Spark, and Microsoft R Server. The focus is primarily on machine learning with Azure HDInsight platform, but review other in-memory, large-scale data analysis platforms, such as R Services with SQL Server 2016, and discuss how to utilize BI tools such as PowerBI and Shiny for dynamic reporting, and report generation."
