# Abstract {-}
## Scalable Machine Learning and Data Science {-}

This book is a guide for doing data analysis with Spark and R. It is organized as a collection of examples of data science problems analyzed with these two technologies, and tries to highlight programming paradigms that make the best of both worlds. It starts with a discussion of using R for data science and machine learning, and describes how to create functional programming pipelines that are data source invariant, easy to write, easy to debug, and easy to deploy! In order to scale out typical R workflows, we showcase how to use Spark, and Microsoft R Server to bring your favorite R functions to large datasets.

## Useful Resources {-}
There are a number of useful resources for Spark, R, and Azure HDInsight. I have listed a few that I found particularly useful.

todo: this should probably got into the .bib file instead, and use citations.
